    <p>Jeep wrangler gas mileage with 32x11.50? I have a 2005 wrangler x i bought it with a 4.56 gearing and wanted a better highway gas mileage and speed so i was going to try and put a larger gear in the transmission on the last gear and i was wondering what manual transmission this jeep has and where i should look to buy the gear i want? Jeep wrangler is a 5 seater suv car available at a price range of rs. Changing the gas will not get you better gas mileage. A modified jeep with heavier tires and steel bumpers will get lower mileage because of the weight. For those keeping score, that is a difference of $1587 in gas per year! When the mt team drove the jeep over the mountains and through the desert in cool, calm weather, it got as much as 23 mpg. I drove this 2018 jeep wrangler with a 3.6l 6 cly and a 5 speed auto 100miles on the highway to see what kind of gas mileage it.
